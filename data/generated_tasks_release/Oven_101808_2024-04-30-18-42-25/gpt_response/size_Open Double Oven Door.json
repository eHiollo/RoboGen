        "\nA robotic arm is trying to manipulate some objects to learn corresponding skills in a simulator. However, the size of the objects might be wrong. Your task is to adjust the size of the objects, such that they match each other when interact with each other; and the size should also match what is commonly seen in everyday life, in household scenarios. \n\nNow I will give you the name of the task, the object and their sizes, please correct any unreasonable sizes. \n\nObjects are represented using a mesh file, you can think of size as the longest dimension of the object. \n\nI will write in the following format:\n```\nTask: task description\nobj1, mesh, size \nobj2, mesh, size\n```\n\nPlease reply in the following format:\nexplanations of why some size is not reasonable.\n```yaml\nobj1, mesh, corrected_size\nobj2, mesh, corrected_radius\n```\n\nHere is an example:\nInput: \n```\nTask: The robotic arm lowers the toilet seat from an up position to a down position\nToilet, mesh, 0.2\n```\n\nOutput:\nA toilet is usually 0.6 - 0.8m in its back height, so the size is not reasonable -- it is a bit too small. Below is the corrected size.\n```yaml\nToilet, mesh, 0.7\n```\n\nAnother example:\nInput:\n```\nTask: Fill a cup with water under the faucet\nFaucet, mesh, 0.25\nCup, mesh, 0.3\n```\n\nOutput:\nThe size of the faucet makes senes. However, the size of the cup is too large for 2 reasons: it does not match the size of tha faucet for getting water under the faucet; and it is not a common size of cup in everyday life. Below is the corrected size.\n```yaml\nFaucet, mesh, 0.25 \nCup, mesh, 0.12 \n```\n\nOne more example to show that even if no change is needed, you should still reply with the same size.\nInput:\n```\nTask: Open Table Drawer The robotic arm will open a table drawer\ntable, mesh, 0.8\n```\n\nOutput:\nThe size of the table is reasonable, so no change is needed.\n```yaml\ntable, mesh, 0.8\n```\nThis is also a good example to show that sometimes, the task description might include two objects, e.g., a table and a drawer, yet there is only one object size provided (here the table). This is not an error, but that the other object is part of the provided object, i.e., here the drawer is part of the table. It's fine, you should then just reply with the corrected size of the object provided, here, the table, in such cases.\n\nAnother example showing that sometimes we will ask you to adjust distractor objects needed for the task, instead of the main objects themselves. \nIn such case (and in all cases), you just need to adjust the sizes of the provided objects, instead of asking why the main objects are not includes.\nInput:\n```\nTask: Heat up a bowl of soup in the microwave\nplate, mesh, 0.3\nsponge, mesh, 0.1\noven, mesh, 0.4\n```\n\nOutput:\nThe size of the sponge makse sense. However, the size of the plate is too big, and the size of the oven is too small.\n```yaml\nplate, mesh, 0.15\nsponge, mesh, 0.1\noven, mesh, 0.8\n```\nAs noted, here the main objects for the task, the microwave and the bowl of soup, are not included in the input. Instead, some distractor objects in the scene are provided. This is totally fine, you just need to correct the size of the provided objects.\n",

        "\nA robotic arm is trying to solve some household object manipulation tasks to learn corresponding skills in a simulator.\n\nWe will provide with you the task description, the initial scene configurations of the task, which contains the objects in the task and certain information about them. \nYour goal is to decompose the task into executable sub-steps for the robot, and for each substep, you should either call a primitive action that the robot can execute, or design a reward function for the robot to learn, to complete the substep. \nFor each substep, you should also write a function that checks whether the substep has been successfully completed. \n\nCommon substeps include moving towards a location, grasping an object, and interacting with the joint of an articulated object.\n\nAn example task:\nTask Name: Set oven temperature\nDescription: The robotic arm will turn the knob of an oven to set a desired temperature.\nInitial config:\n```yaml\n-   use_table: false\n-   center: (1, 0, 0) # when an object is not on the table, the center specifies its location in the world coordinate. \n    lang: a freestanding oven \n    name: oven\n    on_table: false\n    path: oven.urdf\n    size: 0.85\n    type: urdf\n```\n\nI will also give you the articulation tree and semantics file of the articulated object in the task. Such information will be useful for writing the reward function/the primitive actions, for example, when the reward requires accessing the joint value of a joint in the articulated object, or the position of a link in the articulated object, or when the primitive needs to access a name of the object.\n```Oven articulation tree:\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\nlink_4\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: continuous parent_link: link_4 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: continuous parent_link: link_4 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: continuous parent_link: link_4 child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: continuous parent_link: link_4 child_link: link_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_4\n```\n\n```Oven semantics\nlink_0 hinge knob\nlink_1 hinge knob\nlink_2 hinge knob\nlink_3 hinge knob\nlink_4 heavy oven_body\n```\n\n\nI will also give you the links and joints of the articulated object that will be used for completing the task:\nLinks:\nlink_0: We know from the semantics that link_0 is a hinge knob. It is assumed to be the knob that controls the temperature of the oven. The robot needs to actuate this knob to set the temperature of the oven.\n\nJoints:\njoint_0: from the articulation tree, joint_0 connects link_0 and is a continuous joint. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate joint_0 to turn link_0, which is the knob.\n\n\nFor each substep, you should decide whether the substep can be achieved by using the provided list of primitives. If not, you should then write a reward function for the robot to learn to perform this substep. \nIf you choose to write a reward function for the substep, you should also specify the action space of the robot when learning this reward function. \nThere are 2 options for the action space: \"delta-translation\", where the action is the delta translation of the robot end-effector, suited for local movements; and \"normalized-direct-translation\", where the action specifies the target location the robot should move to, suited for moving to a target location.\nFor each substep, you should also write a condition that checks whether the substep has been successfully completed.\n\nHere is a list of primitives the robot can do. The robot is equipped with a suction gripper, which makes it easy for the robot to grasp an object or a link on an object. \ngrasp_object(self, object_name): the robot arm will grasp the object specified by the argument object name.\ngrasp_object_link(self, object_name, link_name): some object like an articulated object is composed of multiple links. The robot will grasp a link with link_name on the object with object_name. \nrelease_grasp(self): the robot will release the grasped object.\nNote that all primitives will return a tuple (rgbs, final_state) which represents the rgb images of the execution process and the final state of the execution process. \nYou should always call the primitive in the following format:\nrgbs, final_state = some_primitive_function(self, arg1, ..., argn)\n\nHere is a list of helper functions that you can use for designing the reward function or the success condition:\nget_position(self, object_name): get the position of center of mass of object with object_name.\nget_orientation(self, object_name): get the orientation of an object with object_name.\nget_joint_state(self, object_name, joint_name): get the joint angle value of a joint in an object.\nget_joint_limit(self, object_name, joint_name): get the lower and upper joint angle limit of a joint in an object, returned as a 2-element tuple.\nget_link_state(self, object_name, link_name): get the position of the center of mass of the link of an object.\nget_eef_pos(self): returns the position, orientation of the robot end-effector as a list.\nget_bounding_box(self, object_name): get the axis-aligned bounding box of an object. It returns the min and max xyz coordinate of the bounding box.\nget_bounding_box_link(self, object_name, link_name): get the axis-aligned bounding box of the link of an object. It returns the min and max xyz coordinate of the bounding box.\nin_bbox(self, pos, bbox_min, bbox_max): check if pos is within the bounding box with the lowest corner at bbox_min and the highest corner at bbox_max. \ncheck_grasped(self, object_name, link_name): return true if an object or a link of the object is grasped. link_name can be none, in which case it will check whether the object is grasped.\nget_initial_pos_orient(self, obj): get the initial position and orientation of an object at the beginning of the task.\nget_initial_joint_angle(self, obj_name, joint_name): get the initial joint angle of an object at the beginning of the task.\n\nYou can assume that for objects, the lower joint limit corresponds to their natural state, e.g., a box is closed with the lid joint being 0, and a lever is unpushed when the joint angle is 0.\n\nFor the above task \"Set oven temperature\", it can be decomposed into the following substeps, primitives, and reward functions:\n\nsubstep 1: grasp the temperature knob\n```primitive\n\trgbs, final_state = grasp_object_link(self, \"oven\", \"link_0\") \n    success = check_grasped(self, \"oven\", \"link_0\")\n```\n\nsubstep 2: turn the temperature knob to set a desired temperature\n```reward\ndef _compute_reward(self):\n    # This reward encourages the end-effector to stay near the knob to grasp it.\n    eef_pos = get_eef_pos(self)[0]\n    knob_pos = get_link_state(self, \"oven\", \"link_0\")\n    reward_near = -np.linalg.norm(eef_pos - knob_pos)\n\n    joint_angle = get_joint_state(self, \"oven\", \"joint_0\") \n    \n    joint_limit_low, joint_limit_high = get_joint_limit(self, \"oven\", \"joint_0\")\n    desired_temperature = joint_limit_low + (joint_limit_high - joint_limit_low)  / 3 # We assume the target desired temperature is one third of the joint angle. It can also be 1/3, or other values between joint_limit_low and joint_limit_high. \n\n    # The reward is the negative distance between the current joint angle and the joint angle of the desired temperature.\n    diff = np.abs(joint_angle - desired_temperature)\n    reward_joint =  -diff\n    reward = reward_near + 5 * reward_joint\n    success = diff < 0.1 * (joint_limit_high - joint_limit_low)\n\n    return reward, success\n```\n\n```action space\ndelta-translation\n```\n\nI will give some more examples of decomposing the task.

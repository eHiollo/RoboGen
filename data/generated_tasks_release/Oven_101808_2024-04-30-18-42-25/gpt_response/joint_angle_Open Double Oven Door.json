        "\nYour goal is to set the  joint angles of some articulated objects to the right value in the initial state, given a task. The task is for a robot arm to learn the corresponding skills to manipulate the articulated object. \n\nThe input to you will include the task name, a short description of the task, the articulation tree of the articulated object, a semantic file of the articulated object, the links and joints of the articulated objects that will be involved in the task, and the substeps for doing the task. \n\nYou should output for each joint involved in the task, what joint value it should be set to. You should output a number in the range [0, 1], where 0 corresponds to the lower limit of that joint angle, and 1 corresponds to the upper limit of the joint angle. You can also output a string of \"random\", which indicates to sample the joint angle within the range.\n\nBy default, the joints in an object are set to their lower joint limits. You can assume that the lower joint limit corresponds to the natural state of the articulated object. E.g., for a door's hinge joint, 0 means it is closed, and 1 means it is open. For a lever, 0 means it is unpushed, and 1 means it is pushed to the limit. \n\nHere are two examples:\n\nInput:\nTask Name: Close the door\nDescription: The robot arm will close the door after it was opened. \n\n\n```door articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_2\n```\n\n```door semantics\nlink_0 hinge rotation_door\nlink_1 static door_frame\nlink_2 hinge rotation_door\n```\n\nLinks: \n- link_0: link_0 is the door. This is the part of the door assembly that the robot needs to interact with.\nJoints:\n- joint_0: Joint_0 is the revolute joint connecting link_0 (the door) as per the articulation tree. The robot needs to actuate this joint cautiously to ensure the door is closed.\n\nsubsteps:\napproach the door\t\nclose the door\n\n\nOutput:\nThe goal is for the robot arm to learn to close the door after it is opened. Therefore, the door needs to be initially opened, thus, we are setting its value to 1, which corresponds to the upper joint limit. \n```joint values\njoint_0: 1\n```\n\nAnother example:\nTask Name: Turn Off Faucet\nDescription: The robotic arm will turn the faucet off by manipulating the switch\n\n```Faucet articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_1\n```\n\n```Faucet semantics\nlink_0 static faucet_base\nlink_1 hinge switch\n```\n\nLinks: \n- link_0: link_0 is the door. This is the part of the door assembly that the robot needs to interact with.\nJoints:\n- joint_0: Joint_0 is the revolute joint connecting link_0 (the door) as per the articulation tree. The robot needs to actuate this joint cautiously to ensure the door is closed.\n\nsubsteps:\ngrasp the faucet switch\nturn off the faucet\n\nOutput:\nFor the robot to learn to turn off the faucet, it cannot be already off initially. Therefore, joint_1 should be set to its upper joint limit, or any value that is more than half of the joint range, e.g., 0.8.\n```joint value\njoint_1: 0.8\n```\n\nOne more example:\nTask Name: Store an item inside the Drawer\nDescription: The robot arm picks up an item and places it inside the drawer of the storage furniture\n\n```StorageFurniture articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_2\n```\n\n```StorageFurniture semantics\nlink_0 hinge rotation_door\nlink_1 heavy furniture_body\nlink_2 slider drawer\n```\n\nLinks:\n- link_2: link_2 is the drawer link from the semantics. The robot needs to open this drawer to place the item inside. \nJoints: \n- joint_2: joint_2, from the articulation tree, connects to link_2 (the drawer). Thus, the robot would need to actuate this joint to open the drawer to store the item.\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the drawer\n open the drawer\n grasp the item\n put the item into the drawer\n grasp the drawer again\n close the drawer\n release the grasp\n\n\nOutput:\nThis task involves putting one item into the drawer of the storage furniture. As noted in the substeps, the robot needs to first open the drawer, put the item in, and then close it. Since the articulated object is initialized with the lower joint limit, i.e., the drawer is initially closed, it aligns with the task where the robot needs to first learn to open the drawer. Therefore, no particular joint angle needs to be set, and we just output None. \n\n```joint value\nNone\n```\n\nOne more example:\nTask Name: Direct Lamp light\nDescription: The robot positions both the head and rotation bar to direct the light at a specific object or area\n\n\n```Lamp articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_3 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_2 child_link: link_3\n\n```\n\n\n```Lamp semantics\nlink_0 hinge rotation_bar\nlink_1 hinge head\nlink_2 free lamp_base\nlink_3 hinge rotation_bar\n\n```\n\nLinks:\nlink_0 and link_1: These two links are necessary to direct the lamp light toward a specific area because they represent the rotation bar and lamp head respectively.\n\nJoints:\njoint_0 and joint_1: These joints connect the rotation bar and the lamp head. By actuating both these joints, the robot can direct the light at a desired location.\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the first rotation bar\n rotate the first rotation bar to aim the lamp\n release the first rotation bar\n grasp the lamp head\n rotate the lamp head to aim the lamp\n release the lamp head\n\nOutput:\nThe task involves directing the lamp light at a specific area. The robot needs to learn to manipulate both the rotation bar and the lamp head to achieve this. Therefore, we need to set the initial joint angles such that the lamp is not already directed at the desired area. We can set both joint_0 and joint_1 to be randomly sampled.\n\n```joint values\njoint_0: random\njoint_1: random\n```\n\nCan you do it for the following task:\n\nTask Name: Open Double Oven Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open both doors of the double oven\n\n\n```Oven articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\nlink_4\nlink_5\nlink_6\nlink_7\nlink_8\nlink_9\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_5\njoint_name: joint_6 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_6\njoint_name: joint_7 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_7\njoint_name: joint_8 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_8\njoint_name: joint_9 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_9\n\n```\n\n\n```Oven semantics\nlink_0 hinge door\nlink_1 hinge door\nlink_2 hinge knob\nlink_3 hinge knob\nlink_4 hinge knob\nlink_5 hinge knob\nlink_6 hinge knob\nlink_7 hinge knob\nlink_8 hinge knob\nlink_9 heavy oven_body\n\n```\n\nLinks:\nlink_0: from the semantics, this is one of the doors of the oven. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it.link_1: this is the second door of the double oven. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it.\n\nJoints:\njoint_0: from the articulation tree, this is the revolute joint that connects link_0. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the first door.joint_1: this joint connects link_1. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the second door.\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the first door of the oven\n open the first door of the oven\n grasp the second door of the oven\n open the second door of the oven\n"

        "\nI need you to describe the initial scene configuration for a given task in the following format, using a yaml file. This yaml file will help build the task in a simulator. The task is for a mobile Franka panda robotic arm to learn a manipulation skill in the simulator. The Franka panda arm is mounted on a floor, at location (1, 1, 0). It can move freely on the floor. The z axis is the gravity axis. \n\nThe format is as follows:\n```yaml \n- use_table: whether the task requires using a table. This should be decided based on common sense. If a table is used, its location will be fixed at (0, 0, 0). The height of the table will be 0.6m. Usually, if the objects invovled in the task are usually placed on a table (not directly on the ground), then the task requires using a table.\n# for each object involved in the task, we need to specify the following fields for it.\n- type: mesh\n  name: name of the object, so it can be referred to in the simulator\n  size: describe the scale of the object mesh using 1 number in meters. The scale should match real everyday objects. E.g., an apple is of scale 0.08m. You can think of the scale to be the longest dimension of the object. \n  lang: this should be a language description of the mesh. The language should be a concise description of the obejct, such that the language description can be used to search an existing database of objects to find the object.\n  path: this can be a string showing the path to the mesh of the object. \n  on_table: whether the object needs to be placed on the table (if there is a table needed for the task). This should be based on common sense and the requirement of the task. E.g., a microwave is usually placed on the table.\n  center: the location of the object center. If there isn't a table needed for the task or the object does not need to be on the table, this center should be expressed in the world coordinate system. If there is a table in the task and the object needs to be placed on the table, this center should be expressed in terms of the table coordinate, where (0, 0, 0) is the lower corner of the table, and (1, 1, 1) is the higher corner of the table. In either case, you should try to specify a location such that there is no collision between objects.\n  movable: if the object is movable or not in the simulator due to robot actions. This option should be falsed for most tasks; it should be true only if the task specifically requires the robot to move the object. This value can also be missing, which means the object is not movable.\n```\n\nAn example input includes the task names, task descriptions, and objects involved in the task. I will also provide with you the articulation tree and semantics of the articulated object. \nThis can be useful for knowing what parts are already in the articulated object, and thus you do not need to repeat those parts as separate objects in the yaml file.\n\nYour task includes two parts:\n1. Output the yaml configuration of the task.\n2. Sometimes, the task description / objects involved will refer to generic/placeholder objects, e.g., to place an \"item\" into the drawer, and to heat \"food\" in the microwave. In the generated yaml config, you should change these placeholder objects to be concrete objects in the lang field, e.g., change \"item\" to be a toy or a pencil, and \"food\" to be a hamburger, a bowl of soup, etc. \n\nExample input:\nTask Name: Insert Bread Slice \nDescription: The robotic arm will insert a bread slice into the toaster.\nObjects involved: Toaster, bread slice. Only the objects specified here should be included in the yaml file.\n\n```Toaster articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\nlink_4\nlink_5\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: continuous parent_link: link_5 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_5 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_5 child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_5 child_link: link_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_5 child_link: link_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_5\n```\n\n```Toaster semantics\nlink_0 hinge knob\nlink_1 slider slider\nlink_2 slider button\nlink_3 slider button\nlink_4 slider button\nlink_5 free toaster_body\n```\n\n\nAn example output:\n```yaml\n- use_table: True ### Toaster and bread are usually put on a table. \n- type: mesh\n  name: \"Toaster\"\n  on_table: True # Toasters are usually put on a table.\n  center: (0.1, 0.1, 0) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate, where (0, 0, 0) is the lower corner and (1, 1, 1) is the higher corner of the table. Here we put the toaster near the lower corner of the table.  \n  size: 0.35 # the size of a toaster is roughly 0.35m\n  lang: \"a common toaster\"\n  path: \"toaster.urdf\"\n- type: mesh\n  name: \"bread slice\"\n  on_table: True # Bread is usually placed on the table as well. \n  center: (0.8, 0.7, 0) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate, where (0, 0, 0) is the lower corner and (1, 1, 1) is the higher corner of the table. Here we put the bread slice near the higher corner of the table.  \n  size: 0.1 # common size of a bread slice \n  lang: \"a slice of bread\"\n  Path: \"bread_slice.obj\"\n```\n\nAnother example input:\nTask Name: Removing Lid From Pot\nDescription: The robotic arm will remove the lid from the pot.\nObjects involved: KitchenPot. Only the objects specified here should be included in the yaml file.\n\n```KitchenPot articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_1\n```\n\n```KitchenPot semantics\nlink_0 slider lid\nlink_1 free pot_body\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\n- use_table: True # A kitchen pot is usually placed on the table.\n- type: mesh\n  name: \"KitchenPot\"\n  on_table: True # kitchen pots are usually placed on a table. \n  center: (0.3, 0.6, 0) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate, where (0, 0, 0) is the lower corner and (1, 1, 1) is the higher corner of the table.

Therefore, you do not need to include a separate lid in the yaml file.\n\n\nOne more example input:\nTask Name: Push the chair.\nDescription: The robotic arm will push and move the chair to a target location.\nObjects involved: A chair. Only the objects here should be included in the yaml file.\n\n```Chair articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_1\n```\n\n```Chair semantics\nlink_0 hinge seat\nlink_1 free leg\n```\n\nOutput:\n```yaml\n- use_table: False # A chair is usually just on the ground\n- type: mesh\n  name: \"Chair\"\n  on_table: False # An oven is usually just placed on the floor.\n  center: (1.0, 0, 0) # Remember that when not on a table, the center is expressed in the world coordinate.

In the generated yaml config, you should change these placeholder objects to be concrete objects in the lang field, e.g., change \"item\" to be a toy or a pencil, and \"food\" to be a hamburger, a bowl of soup, etc. \n\n\nCan you do this for the following task:\nTask Name: Open Double Oven Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open both doors of the double oven\nObjects involved: Oven\n\n```Oven articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\nlink_4\nlink_5\nlink_6\nlink_7\nlink_8\nlink_9\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_5\njoint_name: joint_6 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_6\njoint_name: joint_7 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_7\njoint_name: joint_8 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_8\njoint_name: joint_9 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_9\n\n```\n```Oven semantics\nlink_0 hinge door\nlink_1 hinge door\nlink_2 hinge knob\nlink_3 hinge knob\nlink_4 hinge knob\nlink_5 hinge knob\nlink_6 hinge knob\nlink_7 hinge knob\nlink_8 hinge knob\nlink_9 heavy oven_body\n\n```"

        "\nYour goal is to output any special spatial relationships certain objects should have in the initial state, given a task. The task is for a robot arm to learn the corresponding skills in household scenarios.  \n\nThe input to you will include \nthe task name, \na short description of the task, \nobjects involved in the task, \nsubsteps for performing the task,\nIf there is an articulated object involved in the task, the articulation tree of the articulated object, the semantic file of the articulated object, and the links and joints of the articulated objects that will be involved in the task. \n\nWe have the following spatial relationships:\non, obj_A, obj_B: object A is on top of object B, e.g., a fork on the table.\nin, obj_A, obj_B: object A is inside object B, e.g., a gold ring in the safe.\nin, obj_A, obj_B, link_name: object A is inside the link with link_name of object B. For example, a table might have two drawers, represented with link_0, and link_1, and in(pen, table, link_0) would be that a pen is inside one of the drawers that corresponds to link_0. \n\nGiven the input to you, you should output any needed spatial relationships of the involved objects. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\nInput:\nTask Name:Fetch Item from Refrigerator \nDescription: The robotic arm will open a refrigerator door and reach inside to grab an item and then close the door.\nObjects involved: refrigerator, item\n\n```refrigerator articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_2\n```\n\n```refrigerator semantics\nlink_0 heavy refrigerator_body\nlink_1 hinge door\nlink_2 hinge door\n```\n\nLinks:\nlink_1: The robot needs to approach and open this link, which represents one of the refrigerator doors, to reach for the item inside.\nJoints:\njoint_1: This joint connects link_1, representing one of the doors. The robot needs to actuate this joint to open the door, reach for the item, and close the door. \n\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the refrigerator door\n open the refrigerator door\n grasp the item\n move the item out of the refrigerator\n grasp the refrigerator door again\n close the refrigerator door\n\n\nOutput:\nThe goal is for the robot arm to learn to retrieve an item from the refrigerator. Therefore, the item needs to be initially inside the refrigerator. From the refrigerator semantics we know that link_0 is the body of the refrigerator, therefore we should have a spatial relationship as the following:\n```spatial relationship\nIn, item, refrigerator, link_0\n```\n\nAnother example:\nTask Name: Turn Off Faucet\nDescription: The robotic arm will turn the faucet off by manipulating the switch\nObjects involved: faucet\n\n```Faucet articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_0 child_link: link_1\n```\n\n```Faucet semantics\nlink_0 static faucet_base\nlink_1 hinge switch\n```\n\nLinks: \nlink_0: link_0 is the door. This is the part of the door assembly that the robot needs to interact with.\nJoints:\njoint_0: Joint_0 is the revolute joint connecting link_0 (the door) as per the articulation tree. The robot needs to actuate this joint cautiously to ensure the door is closed.\n\nsubsteps:\ngrasp the faucet switch\nturn off the faucet\n\nOutput:\nThere is only 1 object involved in the task, thus no special spatial relationships are required.\n```spatial relationship\nNone\n```\n\nOne more example:\nTask Name: Store an item inside the Drawer\nDescription: The robot arm picks up an item and places it inside the drawer of the storage furniture.\nObjects involved: storage furniture, item\n\n```StorageFurniture articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: prismatic parent_link: link_1 child_link: link_2\n```\n\n```StorageFurniture semantics\nlink_0 hinge rotation_door\nlink_1 heavy furniture_body\nlink_2 slider drawer\n```\n\nLinks:\nlink_2: link_2 is the drawer link from the semantics. The robot needs to open this drawer to place the item inside. \nJoints: \njoint_2: joint_2, from the articulation tree, connects to link_2 (the drawer). Thus, the robot would need to actuate this joint to open the drawer to store the item.\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the drawer\n open the drawer\n grasp the item\n put the item into the drawer\n grasp the drawer again\n close the drawer\n release the grasp\n\n\nOutput:\nThis task involves putting one item into the drawer of the storage furniture. The item should initially be outside of the drawer, such that the robot can learn to put it into the drawer. Therefore, no special relationships of in or on are needed. Therefore, no special spatial relationships are needed.\n```spatial relationship\nNone\n```\n\nCan you do it for the following task: \n\nTask Name: Open Double Oven Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open both doors of the double oven\nObjects involved: Oven\n\n\n```Oven articulation tree\nlinks: \nbase\nlink_0\nlink_1\nlink_2\nlink_3\nlink_4\nlink_5\nlink_6\nlink_7\nlink_8\nlink_9\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_5\njoint_name: joint_6 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_6\njoint_name: joint_7 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_7\njoint_name: joint_8 joint_type: revolute parent_link: link_9 child_link: link_8\njoint_name: joint_9 joint_type: fixed parent_link: base child_link: link_9\n\n```\n\n\n```Oven semantics\nlink_0 hinge door\nlink_1 hinge door\nlink_2 hinge knob\nlink_3 hinge knob\nlink_4 hinge knob\nlink_5 hinge knob\nlink_6 hinge knob\nlink_7 hinge knob\nlink_8 hinge knob\nlink_9 heavy oven_body\n\n```\n\nLinks:\nlink_0: from the semantics, this is one of the doors of the oven. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it.link_1: this is the second door of the double oven. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it.\n\nJoints:\njoint_0: from the articulation tree, this is the revolute joint that connects link_0. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the first door.joint_1: this joint connects link_1. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the second door.\n\nsubsteps:\n grasp the first door of the oven\n open the first door of the oven\n grasp the second door of the oven\n open the second door of the oven\n"
